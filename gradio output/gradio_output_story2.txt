Begin the story: One night as James was going to bed he had a vision of a beautiful land called Wonduncula where all was peace and harmony. He wanted nothing more than to leave this terrible place and return home to his beloved Stella but knew that it would be impossible without her help. So he went to see what he could do to help restore the paradise that once was. Upon arriving at the enchanted island everything seemed just as it should have been. Birds flew overhead singing their sweet songs; animals roamed free playing together in a blissful calm while humans happily worked on repairing damaged structures and improving things for everyone’s enjoyment. But then James noticed something unusual… everywhere there were signs of human activity but no people! Could they truly have all left? Was this truly the end of civilization? Then suddenly from nowhere a huge army of machines and robots descended upon the peaceful village and began systematically destroying every structure. In seconds the entire town was in ruins with only the most defenseless inhabitants remaining. Terrified by these monsters he ran away back into the forest until finally collapsing into exhaustion beside the riverbank. As soon as he did so he saw hundreds if not thousands of creatures like dark grey wolves appearing one after another pouring down the riverbank towards the village. He watched helplessly as his sanctuary became a slaughterhouse filled with innocent victims as the machine soldiers continued their relentless assault on the village in search of anything valuable or useful. The screams of the dying echoed throughout the valley as those who remained fought valiantly to survive. Suddenly James felt someone tugging at his sleeve signaling him to run quickly past them up onto the hill where he found safety. Unfortunately for him however the villagers followed and as they chased after him across the plains a giant robot appeared emerging from behind a hill casting high beams that illuminated the area making it easy for everyone to see. The villagers attacked the beast which promptly replied firing missiles indiscriminately hitting all present before turning its attention to James charging toward him. To save himself he jumped over the bodies of the fallen warriors running right through some of the corpses still twitching and reaching out trying to grab at him. The monster charged closer however noticing something was wrong with him decided to change course and fired another missile striking one of the large trees nearby causing massive damage and destruction. Just when it looked about to reach James he leapt over one last corpse and landed safely on the other side fleeing into the woods again. Finally safe James made it to a tree stump where he collapsed exhausted wondering how many lives he had taken just to get caught up in the whole affair leaving such chaos and carnage in his wake. The next day as he sat alone pondering his fate he heard something rustling in the bushes close by. Curious he leaned in for a better look seeing three little mice scurrying around nervously surveying the scene. They stopped abruptly as he approached and stared fearfully at him. He asked them why they hid themselves and when he gave them food treats started following him closely until eventually one of the little ones bit him hard in the ankle jolting him awake. Confused James tried to shake off the mouse but instead caused its body parts to fly off scattering on the ground much to the rodent’s dismay. Furious he launched itself at James but luckily managed to escape unharmed. After recovering he explored further finding evidence of enormous battles taking place. Somewhere else within the mountains perhaps even now fighting with giants. Exhausted he returned to his camp feeling depressed knowing he couldn't go back to the village because of the war. What was he going to do now??
The End
