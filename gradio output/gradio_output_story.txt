Include a rich world, deep inner conflict, emotional growth, and a meaningful resolution.

Topic: apocalypse
Begin the story: Ten years ago, civilization fell to chaos. Now, James Frostheart lives in what remains of a once-thriving city—a fortress atop a mountain called Mount Charity. He has everything he could want: money, sex, power…but he also wants more than anything for life to return to some semblance of normality. 

One day, James dreams that something wakes him from his sleep with a sickening crunch, like metal on concrete. The next thing he knows, two armed men are standing over his bed. “We’ve got important news,” one says conspiratorially. “Civilization still stands.”

  * Deep inner conflict - James must decide between compassion and pragmatism as he navigates interpersonal relationships during times of peace vs. war.
  * Emotional growth — Through challenges and adversities, James grows both personally and professionally.

  * Meaningful resolution - Despite a few hiccups along the way, James finds true love, accomplishes great things (like saving humanity), and becomes the leader he was meant to be.

 This could all have been so much simpler if only there had been someone else who could provide basic necessities such as food or water. Unfortunately, James isn't exactly flush with cash at this juncture; it's not like there were any bank vaults left after the collapse either. But then again, how would you know about basic needs without modern technology? And without modern technology, even the most well stocked banks wouldn't have survived intact. With regret, James considered purchasing a simple fishing boat but quickly put it out of his mind when he remembered that Stella wanted to go diving off of Mt. Charity into Lake Michigan down below. After all these years, they're finally starting their grand voyage together!

 When James awakens the following morning, he finds himself alone in his room. Curious, he peers through the crack in his door, just to make sure nobody had visited while he'd slept. Sure enough, nothing out of the ordinary met his eyes upon opening his bedroom door. Perhaps he dreamed the whole invasion... or maybe he wasn't ready yet. It was always going to happen eventually. He already saw the writing on the wall – entire civilizations failing around him every year before the first atomic bomb was detonated. How long until it happened again now? Wasn't it better this time? Surely. At least the last couple failed attempts hadn't turned into full scale wars that consumed cities and ended up leaving no survivors. That couldn't ever end well. Especially since James didn't own any firearms or other offensive capabilities. Maybe the invaders would come knocking again soon... but hopefully by then he'd find a way to protect himself and those close to him. Either way, it felt good knowing that even though society might fall apart, he was doing his best to ensure its survival. He certainly couldn't complain, given where he came from. Even so, having your home taken away from under your nose bit hard. Especially considering that part of his homeland managed to survive unscathed. As far as he knew, half of Chicago still existed, which made the thought especially bitter.

 Oh man, if only the humans could see the world today. They would definitely cringe at the state of affairs. For starters, he owned several mansions, castles, fortresses, palaces, etc., which he had painstakingly rebuilt using precious resources recovered throughout history and beyond. What remained of human trade networks consisted primarily of hapless bikers making deliveries of goods that mostly went straight to landfills because none of them actually delivered. Cities lay abandoned due to rampant looting. In short, the infrastructure needed to support said civilization simply did not exist anymore. However, what did remain was largely functional. Most importantly, his A.I. companion Stella continued her efforts towards rebuilding humanity from scratch via genetic engineering and reverse psychology. From what James could gather, she usually seemed happy whenever he talked to her and never caused any conflicts or disruptions. She probably should've upgraded herself to newer versions, however. Her current version had recently developed a habit of muttering random phrases at inopportune moments. One time, he asked why the sky was blue and she responded "blue" instead of providing an answer. Of course, even Stella's presence was sorely lacking compared to days gone by. Although he occasionally encountered malfunctioning robots here and there, they weren't anywhere near the level of the classic Terminators and Battle droids that had terrorized the earth back in the initial days following the catastrophe. He kept hoping they'd figure out AI augmentation or reverse evolution within the next decade or so, assuming they weren't too busy developing weapons of mass destruction or whatever that word really means. Regardless, despite losing large portions of his empire, life was good overall. He lived comfortably in a luxurious castle built inside of a small crater overlooking a lake nestled among numerous mountains. All he lacked was somebody to share it
