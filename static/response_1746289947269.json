My parents were always vigilant for dangers beyond our borders - natural disasters, human attacks, even rogue elements within our own government. We had to be ready at all times for any possible eventuality because it was simply impossible to know when disaster might strike. Our family grew over time as my mother became more experienced with taking care of herself and myself while also keeping everyone else fed, clothed, sheltered, and safe. This lifestyle left us well prepared should something happen to our planet and made us better equipped to deal with its eventual demise from extreme climate change and depletion of resources due to lack of biodiversity. But until then...we would survive. And together we did just that; growing crops, building a shelter for ourselves underground, raising livestock to keep us fed and warm. It wasn't perfect by any means, but it provided enough food, water, warmth, safety, and protection from whatever awaited us below ground. \nOne day, shortly after moving into this newly built subterranean abode, there came a knock on the door. To this day I still remember every detail vividly. The sound of the knocking seemed odd given what little daylight remained—it was barely morning, yet here stood someone at our front gate asking to come inside. They must have mistaken our heavy steel bars for an unlocked entrance since they gave them no heed. Before I could answer the visitor, however, another loud knocks echoed through the walls and floors of the house.\nI rushed downstairs to open the portal only to see the figure of a man standing before me. He wore worn military attire with several pockets holding weapons of various types – some exotic looking rifles and pistols I’d never seen before along side modern machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, and other assorted pieces of armament. Even from this distance he exuded menace, his presence filling up much of the space around him. As he approached the edge of the portals opening he spoke first; “Open up, you stubborn wench.” He paused briefly, probably noting the fear written clearly across my face. Then added, “It will be so easy if you just opened those damned gates!” I looked down to where he pointed, noticing immediately how easily they slid aside giving access to a large courtyard filled with tall trees and lush green grasses. In response to his words I pushed harder on the buttons trying to escape his grasp, straining against my bonds until finally one button released allowing me to break free from their grip. \n“You…you can’t escape,” I stammered shaking slightly as adrenaline coursed through my body. He grabbed hold again trying to force me back toward the doors, but once past I turned and ran straight toward the nearest tree hoping to lose sight of him. Unfortunately my pursuer quickly caught up leaving little opportunity for stealth. However despite running full tilt into the forest I managed to dodge away from him thanks in part to the cover of thick foliage but most likely thanks to pure luck. With new found energy following my instinct rather than my emotions or logic I continued to run deeper into the woods until eventually coming upon a clearing where I hoped to find refuge.\nAs soon as I stepped foot onto solid ground the stranger was upon me, tackling me hard to the earth causing dirt and gravel to fly everywhere. Luckily my captor didn’t realize it hadn’t worked which allowed me to roll away just far enough not to get smashed. He pursued relentlessly and pulled out his knife attempting to cut me down, but I scrambled backwards into the darkness of the forest surrounding us. The fight wasn’t going anywhere good considering both parties wielding sharp objects, but my opponent lacked the size to do much damage. Yet he kept persistently pursuing me until finally finding a way behind me. Just as he lunged forward I rolled underneath him and jumped off of a small cliff. Landing softly on the other side I took stock of my situation, relieved to note I was now above the rough terrain instead of on it. Looking about I saw numerous patches of snow scattered throughout the area, which suggested winter had already taken root.\nStripping off my jacket I used it to wipe blood from cuts and bruises covering my skin from falling victim to his claws and teeth (his attempt to bite me). Once finished I decided to take charge and try to discover some sort of path leading upward so that I could track down help. Facing east I scanned the horizon carefully and spotted the bright white light of a nearby village which meant I would either need to climb my way back to civilization or seek aid elsewhere. After a quick search of the rocky landscape I noticed four distinct tracks heading westward directly towards the city lights. Although my muscles ached, adrenaline continuing pumping through my veins and cold settling into my bones, I set off purposefully walking alongside the faint prints aiming to follow them higher into the hills. \n\nA few hours",
